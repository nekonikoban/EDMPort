Audio Visualisation
The project is made for entertainment purposes with local database tracks and also with Deezer API in which you can listen to any track provided for 30 seconds. 
Evey Deezer track has a direct link to owner website where you can listen to full version.
And of course there are some visualisations in the native player in which you can change the visualiser density, and the other options are in development right now 
regarding visualisations.
NOTE: if you decide to clone or download (the repo contains tracks around 1GB), you can exclude the directory localaudio_db.
